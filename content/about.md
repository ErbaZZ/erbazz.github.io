# Experience

**Summer Research Intern at University of Bremen (Bremen, Germany)** - *Jun - Aug 2018*

Worked on a short project at the Sustainable Communication Networks Department (ComNets), University of Bremen. Learned and implemented a project using TensorFlow to create a neural network model and implemented an Android application to make predictions using the created model.

# Highlighted Projects

**AppSec Pipeline Framework** - *Aug 2018 - Present*

Developing a framework based on OWASP AppSec Pipeline for developers to adapt and use the framework to automate the vulnerabilities testing process of their own software without the need to implement the whole pipeline by themselves, reducing the complexity and increasing the efficiency.

*Tool: Docker, Jenkins, OWASP ZAP, OWASP DefectDojo*


**[Android Phone Resources Usage Pattern Prediction Using TensorFlow](https://github.com/ErbaZZ/TensorFlowResourcesPrediction)** - *Jun - Aug 2018*

Project done during the internship at the University of Bremen. TensorFlow was used to analyze mobile phone status records to predict the future usage of the phone resources per user basis by creating and training a machine learning model with phone status records. An Android application was implemented to collect and feed the phone status records into the trained model to make predictions.

*Programming Language: Python, Java (Android) - Tool/Library: Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, Keras, Android Studio*

**[Twitter Trend Geolocation Visualization from Time Zone Data](https://github.com/ErbaZZ/TwitterStreaming)** - *Dec 2017*

Using python to retrieve Twitter tweets stream and extract the time zone data to approximate their geolocation and visualize them on the world map in the form of heatmap.

*Programming Language: Python - Tool/Library: Jupyter Notebook, Twitter API, Google Maps API, Tweepy, Geopy*

**[YouGle](https://github.com/ErbaZZ/SimpleSearchEngine)** - *Sep 2017*

Simple indexing and retrieval system for a search engine done for Information Storage and Retrieval course. The indexer builds an uncompressed index over a corpus, and retriever accepts boolean conjunctive queries to look up and provide the result.

*Programming Language: Java*
