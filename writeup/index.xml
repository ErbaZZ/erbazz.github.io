      <description>In August, I had a chance to participate in an online CTF competition called Financial Cybersecurity Bootcamp 2018, which is a jeopardy style competition with the time limit of 24 hours. Together with my team, !IsCaptured, we solved 4 of the challenges and became eligible to participate in the final round.
Finalist Teams Announcement
The final round was held at the Bank of Thailand Learning Center at 27 October. The style of the competition is different from the first round, as the problems are sequential, such that you need to solve the first challenge in order to continue to the next and so on.</description>
